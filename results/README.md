## Results

This folder contains the core results and notebooks for reproducing the analysis. The text files contain the performance and timing results on the two datasets. The `analysis.ipynb` file reproduces all results shown in the paper. The other two notebooks (`convert_results.ipynb` and `timing_results.ipynb`) are used to process the raw data. These raw data are available to download at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Timy29SHAJyCJ5pkHYiKlRk_n0ZC_liP?usp=sharing
