## Data

This folder contains the code used to create the noisy data. The `create_dirty_align_data.py` file takes as input training size and a list of error rates, and produces a set of (dirty) training and test data based on an `ent_links` file. The `create_dirty_triple_.py` files take as input a relational triple filename and error rates to produce dirty triples.  

The data used in our experiments are available to download at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e2NlKGHGvcHPG7FDIPz_aGCRt19DLdP7?usp=sharing
